# Reboot-server-planning
CSP model to get a schedule for server rebooting by using Choco Solver


There is two modelisations:
* Naive CSP by considering all constraints
* Inspired by Bin packing with cluster constraints and preferencies constraint


All test were made with a processor intel i5-3470 (3.20GHZ) with 8gb RAM
